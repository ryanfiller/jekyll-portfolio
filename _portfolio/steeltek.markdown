Steel•Tek, a sub-brand of [B&K Industries](http://www.bkproducts.com/), is a product line that specialized in push-fit metal plumbing products, specifically aimed at people interested in using them for components of DIY construction products at home.

## Pinterest Feel for a Construction Audience

RocketFuel was also completing a branding project for B&K Industries along side the Steel•Tek website, and because of my extensive experience doing DIY pluming on my aquarium I was chosen to represent the creative team during most of the client communications. During our initial kick-off meetings the client communicated that they wanted to strike a balance between appealing to the "Pinterst" user who might be browsing the internet for trendy project to complete at home and a more typical contractor who might be looking for an easy way to add a fence or a railing to a project.
We decided to go in two directions for our homepages designs, one highlighting the idea of user submitted project blogs, and a more traditional layout that emphasized the list of parts used in construction.

With the goal of simplifying the process of handing off a project from the design team to the dev team, this project was the first at RocketFuel to utilize an interactive style tile using [Corkscrew](http://acme.ftsdev.com/styleguide/templates). Using this system, I was able to make several static html components that the dev team could plug into our CMS. This also let me focus on fine-tuning some of the more complex interactions we designed for the site.

## Marketing a Cool New Site After You Make It

We also helped Steel•Tek set up a social media marketing plan, to which my contribution was a series of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram templates they could use to market future projects to home DIY-ers. These templates gave them a quick way to start posting projects as well as an easy way to stay on brand as their social media following grew.

This site won a Silver Addy from the [Memphis AAF](http://youcoulduseawin.com/) in the category of Consumer Website Design.
