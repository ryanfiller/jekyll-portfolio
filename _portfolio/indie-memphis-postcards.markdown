Indie Memphis is a local organization that hosts a yearly independant film festival.


So I know we did them to promote the 2016 Film Fest, but where did the theme come from?


[1:26]
Was the sci-fi thing just because they were to promote rocketfuel or did that tie into the festival somehow?

both, cuz you know we’re good like that

the spacey/sci-fi themes fit in with our brand persona, and each one was modeled on a different classic B-movie genre (man vs. machine / perils of the deep / space exploration)


[1:29]
so, the subject matter gave people a view into our geeky/pop culture appreciation & the narratives we chose to focus on celebrated film culture/history


[1:31]
i hope that’s helpful!

that is helpful. were b movies a thing at this year’s festival or was it just to tie into the overall theme of films?


butler
[1:49 PM]
there wasn’t any specific b-movie film theme. (the theme last year was suuuuuuuper generic: “film for all” :face_with_rolling_eyes:) i just saw that as a way to connect our brand persona to the film milieu


ryan
[1:50 PM]
okay, cool. that helps.


[1:50]
Yeah, I tried googling last year to see if there way any info about a theme but that’s all I could find and there wasn’t a whole of info for what that even really meant.


butler
[1:52 PM]
yeah, tbh, sullivan was way lazy last year with the festival branding. they just slapped a text framing element on top of some b&w photos


[1:53]
i get what they were going for with that tagline, trying to get across the point that indie memphis has inclusivity at the heart of its programming model, but i think they could’ve done it in a more stylish & specific way


[1:54]
the witz creative branding the year before that was sloppy & little goofy, but at least it had a very individual perspective



rocketfuel was a sponsor in exchange for doing probono work, this was our leave behind

These were like, for RocketFuel? But we put them at Indie Memphis?
