HACKmemphis is is a yearly hackathon that takes place, sponsored mainly by the [Memphis Technology Foundation.](http://www.memphistechnology.org/){:target="_blank"} The event encourages developers, designers, and makers from all around the city to come together for a 3 day weekend of collaboration.

Each year the organization reaches out to a different local artist to design an event shirt that emboies the spirit of the event.

For the 2016 shirt I decided on a deconstruction of the H logo with each of the ascenders of the letter representing a different aspect of the event. Clockwise starting in the top left, these are 3D printing, phycials construction, digital elements, and planning/modeling.

Because the shirt needed to be printed in only two colors at Custom Ink, shades, gradients, and transparencies needed to be converted to halftones.
